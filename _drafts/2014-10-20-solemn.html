<p>I used to care so damn much about the web. I would get upset about missing alt attributes, Flash and Internet Explorer.</p>

<p><b>Maybe it’s because I’m better.</b> I’m a <i>good</i> designer today. I really am. I used to be frustrated in every project — now I’m never frustrated. My clients keep throwing interesting challenges at and I work hard to help them as best I can. But it never becomes <i>that</i> challenging. I always know with comfort that I can solve the problem at hand. I promise to have it done by Thursday and I deliver on Thursday. No excitement, no staying up late. Maybe that’s why I care less — because today, very few projects are personal to me. The backside of being a professional I guess.</p>

<p><b>Or maybe it’s because the values of the web developer community has changed.</b> It used to be about ideas. We debated web standards. We read <i>“The Elements of Typographic Style”</i> to understand how to bring the history of typography into the web era. We listened to Wilson Miner explain what happens <a href=”http://vimeo.com/34017777”>when we build</a> things. Today, we’re obsessing over tools and superficial design choices. We use package managers to download as many frameworks and libraries as possible. We re-invent the wheel — this time in node! — because… you lost me.</p>

<p><b>Maybe it’s me.</b> I see things differently today.</p>

<p><b>Maybe it’s just a phase.</b></p>

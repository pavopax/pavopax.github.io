## Workflow

### Vim
I write all my code in out-of-the-box [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). The editing capabilities are amazing — you can do so much, so efficiently, without ever touching your trackpad. Another reson for using Vim is that it makes you a better programmer (insert flamewar). With Atom, Sublime, Xcode and what not, you get autocomplete, validation hints, snippets etc — basically everything you need to make sure you never _actually_ learn the syntax by heart. I didn't want that, so I went back to basics. 

### Terminal
Just two years ago, I hated the Terminal. Whenever an open source project required me to do something in the Terminal, I would let out a disgruntled moan. Today, things are different. **I live in the Terminal**. It's home to me. My day-to-day workflow typically involves opening the terminal, navigating to ```/server/current-project/```, firing up a new tab with ```grunt --watch``` or ```jekyll serve --watch```. Then I edit files from inside the Terminal (see Vim) and commit the using command-line git. Today, the Finder feels awkward to me and that's a good thing.

### Git
At Upperdog, we use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to version control all our code. For private repositories, we use [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) instead of [GitHub](https://github.com) because the pricing model is better. For everything else, GitHub is amazing. I use Git from the command line.

## Tools

### Sass
I write all my CSS in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). It allows me to write more structured, maintainable and cross-browser-friendly code. I used to prefer [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), but over the last year, Sass won me over.

### Bourbon
[Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) is a set of Sass mixins. It's very minimalistic and non-optinionated. It's also very intuitive — if you know your CSS you know Bourbon.

### Grunt
We use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as a build tool on most projects. We minify assets, concatenate files, generate favicons and much more. Checkout our [Boilerplate on GitHub](https://github.com/Upperdog/boilerplate) if you're interested in the details.

### Chrome Dev Tools
The [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) helps me understand the way the web browser interacts with my code. I debug scripts, find performance bottlenecks and iterate my designs. (A big shout out to the [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) — so much awesome going on there!)

### MAMP
[MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/) makes it simple for us to set up Apache servers locally. We have considered using something like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), but because our server configurations are often close-to-default, MAMP works just fine for us.

## Design
When I'm not designing in the browser, I use the following tools:

### Sketch
I use [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) for illustrating, prototyping and designing web sites and UIs. I love how both pixel- and vector-based work feels native and “right” in Sketch. It's also up-to-date with what designers and developers are _actually_ doing in a design app today – exporting SVGs, @2x images etc.

### Photoshop
I use [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/se/products/photoshop.html) to quickly mock up ideas on existing projects. I take a screenshot and quickly make some modifications — it's often much faster than doing the same thing in the browser. I also use Photoshop to add a final layer of post processing to illustrations and photos.

### Keynote
I love [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/). It's an incredibly underrated app. I often use it to prototype animations and interactions. Seriously, checkout [Magic Move](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/animating-with-keynote) — it's an incredibly fast and powerful way to explain how you want an object to move from A to B.

## Writing
The ability to write is [incredibly important](http://vimeo.com/5802114) for designers. I use the following applications:

### iA Writer
When formatting is less important, I use [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/). It's wonderful in it's simplicity. It uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) by default which is my preferred way to write.

### Pages
[Pages](https://www.apple.com/mac/pages/) is my favorite word processor. I use it to produce estimates, time plans, reports etc. Like the rest of the iWork suite, it does a good job of combining simplicity with power.

## Workflow

### Vim
I write all my code in out-of-the-box Vim. The editing capabilities are amazing — you can do so much, so efficiently, without ever touching your trackpad. Another reson for using Vim is that it makes you a better programmer. With Atom, Sublime, XCode and what not, you get autocomplete, validation hints, snippets etc. — basically everything you need to make sure you never become a good programmer. I didn't want that, so I went back to basics. 

### Terminal
Just two years ago, I hated the Terminal. Whenever an open source project required me to do something in the Terminal, I would let out a disgruntled moan. Today, things are different. **I live in the Terminal**. The Terminal is home to me. My day-to-day workflow typically involves opening the terminal, navigating to ```/server/current-project/```, firing up a new tab with ```grunt --watch``` or ```jekyll serve --watch```. Then I edit files from inside the Terminal (see Vim) and commit the using command-line git.

### Git
At Upperdog, we use Git to version control all our code. For private repositories, we use Bitbucket instead of GitHub because the pricing model is better. For everything else, GitHub is amazing. I use Git from the command line.

## Tools

### Sass
I write all my CSS in Sass. It allows me to write more structured, maintainable and cross-browser-friendly code. I used to prefer LESS, but over the last year, Sass won me over.

### Bourbon
Bourbon is a set of Sass mixins. It's very minimalistic and unoptinionated. It's also very intuitive — if you know your CSS you know Bourbon.

### Grunt
We use Grunt as a build tool on most projects. We minify assets, concatenate files, generate favicons and much more. Checkout our Boilerplate on GitHub if you're interested in the details.

### Chrome Dev Tools
The Inspector helps me understand the way the web browser interacts with my code. I debug scripts, find performance bottlenecks and iterate my designs. (A big shout out to the Firefox Developer Tools — so much awesome going on there!)

### MAMP
MAMP makes it simple for us to set up Apache servers locally. We have considered using something like Vagrant, but because our server configurations are often close-to-default, MAMP works just fine for us.

I don't know much about illustration other than that I enjoy it immensely. This spring, I spent a few afternoons imitating one of my Casio watches. I did my best to recreate the surfaces, materials, how the light casts shadows behind the buttons and so on. I used Sketch for 98% of the work (including glares and reflection) and only did some light post-processing in Photoshop.

What a fun and novel event has just occurred in the history of mankind/robots.

An ad guy from Big Company speaks something on TV and thereby activates devices
in thousands of random people's homes.

This device/robot reads out a paragraph from a website which is written and
curated by random millions of people as a source of truth for the remaining
billions of people.

Some members of the public play a joke and just go in and slightly rewrite this
bible, after which the robot automatically reads out the new version in
thousands of people's homes.
 
Then the maker of the robot (who in the past used the robot to do unsolicited
advertising in private homes) changes the code in the robot's brain so it
doesn't follow the instructions of random dude speaking at it from the TV.

In summary, it's still humans controlling the robots, not (yet?) the other way
around.

The full story is [on BBC here](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39589013).

Did I beat Chris Matyszczyk to the spot about this? Granted, he would write this 100x more wittily. 

[Apparently not](https://www.cnet.com/news/burger-king-ad-intentionally-sets-off-google-home/).

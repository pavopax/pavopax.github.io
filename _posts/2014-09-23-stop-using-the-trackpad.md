<p class="intro">The trackpad is not your friend. In fact, in terms of productivity, it is the exact opposite. Every time you move your hands from the keyboard to reach for the trackpad you loose a few seconds, or worse, your concentration.</p>

Over the last year I've been working actively to reduce my use of the trackpad. I've gone from performing most of the day's tasks with trackpad to only using it sparingly. Today, I could probably survive a full workday without using the trackpad at all.   **This is my five-step-list to becoming a better keyboard user:**

## Memorize keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts are key (pun intended) to finalizing your divorce from the trackpad. Switching between apps, composing new mail, browsing the web, moving files around on your desktop…you don't actually need the trackpad for any of these tasks — especially if you're a developer.

Try to learn one new keyboard shortcut each day. Whenever you find yourself performing the same task over and over using the trackpad, stop what you're doing and see if there is a keyboard shortcut instead. In OS X, use the help search to quickly learn new shortcuts. Search for the task you're performing — OS X will point to the menu item with the keyboard shortcut next to it.

Dan Rodney has [a nice list of (Mac) keyboard shortcuts](http://www.danrodney.com/mac/).

## Use the Terminal
If you're working with code, you need no start using the Terminal. It doesn't matter if you're a senior back-end developer or a junior web designer. If you are dragging files around by hand in Finder, you are loosing precious time that could have been spent learning new technologies. (Plus, you're missing out on all the interesting things that are going on in the developer community right now.)

## Use Vim
If you are serious about reducing your trackpad usage and willing to try different code editors, I recommend giving Vim a try. Vim doesn't use a cursor like the other editors. You can't click the text to insert the cursor and you certainly can't select text using by dragging your cursor. In other words; your trackpad is useless in Vim.

Instead, you use your keyboard to navigate the text. To *actually* write something, you need to press “i” to enter “insert mode”. Pressing escape takes you back. It's not something you learn over a day, but once you become better, it's hard to use another editor. The best way to learn Vim is to open the terminal and type “vimtutor” — it will help you get a grasp of the basic concepts.

## Make OS X more keyboard friendly
In addition to learning different keyboard shortcuts in OS X, you can configure the system to be even more keyboard friendly. In System Preferences, navigate to Keyboard ➝ Shortcuts. In the bottom, click the radio button that says “All controls”. You can now tab through all user interface elements throughout the system.

**Update:** In response to this article, [Rikard Ekberg](https://twitter.com/kroofy) recommended [ShortCat](https://shortcatapp.com/) which takes things one step further.

## Add-ons for the browser
I use the [type-ahead-find](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/type-ahead-find/cpecbmjeidppdiampimghndkikcmoadk) chrome extension to quickly navigate the web using only the keyboard. If you spot a link on a web site, you simply type the first characters in it — the plugin focuses the link and you can press enter to follow it.

## Summary
Becoming less trackpad dependent has transformed the way I work. It allows me to be more effective and makes me more focused. I hope it can do the same for you.

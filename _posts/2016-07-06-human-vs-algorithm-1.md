*"Algorithms don't understand the subtlety and the mixing of [music] genres. So we hired hundreds of the best people we know." - Jimmy Iovine, on curation in Apple Music.*

Though we increasingly hear about the successes of machine learning algorithms, there are areas where the human touch still has the upper hand.

Below is a list of a few human-curated tech products, and [here is a more detailed write up](https://mondaynote.com/human-curation-is-back-f32bc0ccc2aa#.15r5j0n9m) on this topic.

**Apple Music**. Jimmy Iovine, head of Apple Music, [says "music deserves elegance" and that current "utilities" are "sterile," and "programmed by algorithms and numbing."](http://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tech-gaming/jimmy-iovine-interview-producer-talks-apple-music-zane-lowe-and-taylor-swift-s-wrath-10442663.html) He and his savant-like knowledge of the music industry - he worked with stars from John Lennon to Dr. Dre - [is, according to some, the chief product Apple bought when it spent $3 billion on Beats.](http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-acquired-beats-just-so-that-it-could-hire-jimmy-iovine-2015-9)

**Twitter Moments**. This news feed is human-curated, and [has attracted a lot of attention for that fact](http://theconversation.com/does-twitter-moments-herald-the-comeback-of-human-beings-49417).

[**theSkimm news**](http://www.theskimm.com) : “Each writeup in theSkimm, [which is entirely written and edited by the duo](http://www.fastcompany.com/3021236/most-creative-people/how-theskimm-became-the-must-read-newsletter-for-women), features a brief synopsis of the news, some background and analysis, and the takeaway, or (you guessed it) theSkimm.” Contrast this with the [increasing number of machine-written news](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/opinion/sunday/if-an-algorithm-wrote-this-how-would-you-even-know.html?_r=0).

Even **PayPal** fights fraud with [a combination of machine learning and human analysts](http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/08/25/paypal-fights-fraud-with-machine-learning-and-human-detectives/). Sharing the same co-founder as PayPayl, the secretive data analysis startup Palantir has found success with [a similar formula](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-11-22/palantir-the-war-on-terrors-secret-weapon)

title: "Deflating Big Data Hubris"

The highs and lows of Google Flu trends, "once a poster child for the power of big-data analysis," serve as a case study for David Lazer, Ryan Kennedy, Gary King, et al, in their Science Magazine\* article "The Parable of Google Flu: Traps in Big Data Analysis." 

In the age of "big data hubris," here are two takeaways from their analysis:

* Don't neglect old lessons learned, but combine new methods with previous wisdom:  

> "Big data hubris" is the often implicit assumption that big data are a substitute for, rather than a supplement to, traditional data collection and analysis.

* Aim for transparency and replicability when publishing your models:  

> "Science is a cumulative endeavor, and to stand on the shoulders of giants requires that scientists be able to continually assess work on which they are building [...] Accumulation of knowledge requires fuel in the form of data."

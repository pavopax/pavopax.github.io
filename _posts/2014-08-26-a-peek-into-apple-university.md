From a *New York Times* article\* "Inside Apple's Internal Training Program", some highlights on simplicity in Apple:

* how Picasso's bull drawings\* are similar to an Apple mouse: "You go through more iterations until you can simply deliver your message in a very concise way"

* the effort is hidden: "a gleaming veneer that masks a great deal of effort"

* a Google remote has 78 buttons. Apple's has three.

Last, on "the Best Things, which is an actual Apple University course title:

> "[The course] takes its name from a quotation by Mr. Jobs. Its purpose is to remind employees to surround themselves with the best things, like talented peers and high-quality materials, so that they can do their best work."

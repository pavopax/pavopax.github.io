> Great design comes from great designers.

- Fred Brooks

Below are more quotes and ideas from Fred Brooks, of *The Mythical Man-Month*
fame, who is well-respected in [Silicon Valley engineer
culture](https://www.palantir.com/engineering-culture/).

# Fred Brooks on software and design

  * The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely
    what to build
  * the client does not know what he wants
  * it is really impossible for a client, even working with a software
    engineer, to specify completely, precisely, and correctly the exact
    requirements of a modern software product before trying some versions of
    the product.
  * Grow, don't build software
  * Do rapid prototyping. Enthusiasm jumps when there is a running system, even
    a simple one
  * develop ways to grow great designers

## How to grow great designers?

* Systematically identify top designers as early as possible. The best are
  often not the most experienced.
* Assign a career mentor to be responsible for the development of the prospect,
  and carefully keep a career file.
* Devise and maintain a career development plan for each prospect, including
  carefully selected apprenticeships with top designers, episodes of advanced
  formal education, and short courses, all interspersed with solo-design and
  technical leadership assignments.
* Provide opportunities for growing designers to interact with and stimulate
  each other.

# Last

* The gap between the best software engineering practice and the average
  practice is very wide - perhaps wider than in any other engineering
  discipline.

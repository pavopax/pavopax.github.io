Below are some characteristics of a reproducible analysis, in contrast to a non-reproducible analysis.

Reproducible:

- You can rerun the entire analysis, from data download to full output/report generation, by clicking one “button” (running one command)
- If data sources or other things change upstream, you only need to tweak a few things

Non-reproducible:

- Drag and drop interfaces
- Naked program files
    - That is, R, SAS, Python, or other program files, without accompanying shell script or Makefile to delineate program run order

Do you love R's `dplyr`?

The only possible answers are "Yes, it changed my life" or "Never used it, but
I'm dying to since I constantly hear about the love!".

Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to declare `dplyr` a top 10
invention in all of technology, in the past 10 years.

Moreover, I am looking forward to other groups embracing
the
[Tidy Tools Manifesto](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html).

Please disseminate this award widely.

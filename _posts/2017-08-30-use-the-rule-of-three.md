title: 'When programming, consider the rule of three'

In software engineering, there is a rule of three which can make your
programming work more efficient.

Here are some quotes to get you inspired to think about it and use it:

> The first rule of 3. Don’t worry so much about code duplication if you only
> have two classes or two functions or whatever. Engineers often focus way too
> much on reducing duplicated code.

> If you are building the first implementation of some hairy unknown problem,
> don’t assume you’re going to nail it. Take shortcuts. Hack around nasty
> problems. You’re probably not going to keep this system anyway — at some
> point it’s going to break.

> You need at least 3 examples before you solve the right problem.

> To build something truly reusable, you must convince three different
> audiences to use it thoroughly first.

> So the next time you think "I've built a reusable thing!", stop, and think
> "how can I find three users, customers, or audiences, to prove that I've
> built something reusable?" instead.

I'm keeping a list of R packages for a variety of applications. 

The goal is to keep this list fresh. Therefore, I exclude older versions of
packages which have been replaced (eg, I exclude `reshape2` in favor of the
newer `tidyr`).

Naturally, there is a preference for [Hadley's](http://hadley.nz) packages.

If you only want the essentials, then this is my list:  
`dplyr, tidyr, magrittr, ggplot2`

Let me know what you think [on twitter.](http://twitter.com/pavopax)

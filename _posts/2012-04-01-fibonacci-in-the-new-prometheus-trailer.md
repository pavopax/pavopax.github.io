<p class="intro">Whilst watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOOJl5lWNfM">the new Prometheus trailer</a> this morning, I discovered some familiar design patterns like the Fibonacci sequence and grid layouts. Someone on the production team clearly did his homework.</p>

In this shot, the Fibonacci sequence is used to balance the image.

A seven column grid is used to structure the elements of this frame.

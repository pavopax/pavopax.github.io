I'm a designer and developer in love with everything that lives in the browser. I am also — inevitably — a co-founder, project manager, information architect, strategist and many other things depending on who you ask. You can find me at various places around the web:

* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/martenbjork/)
* [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/martenbjork)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/martenbjork)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martenbjork)

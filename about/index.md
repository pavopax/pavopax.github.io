<h1>Current and past research</h1>

<p>I have a background in applied statistics, specifically in the field of public health. I currently apply statistical methods to the design and analysis of clinical trials at <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/cbar" target="_blank">Harvard School of Public Health</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, I worked with Dr. Heather Ribaudo, Director of Biostatistics and Programming, on the design of <a href="http://reprievetrial.org" target="_blank">REPRIEVE, the largest study ever in our network</a>, which included simulated power analysis (in SAS) of Cox survival models in the presence of "competing risks." Currently, we are developing statistical and data monitoring plans with our collaborators at Massachusetts General Hospital and elsewhere.  At the same time, I am involved in three other longitudinal studies; I combine and analyze datasets to produce graphical summaries and reports for our investigators and the public at large. </p>

<p>While doing my Masters at the University of Michigan, I modeled the hormonal response of cortisol using functional GLM (in R) with <a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/iscr/faculty/profile.cfm?uniqname=brisa">Prof. Brisa Sánchez</a>, where instead of using a summary statistic such as slope of response, or area under the curve, we wanted to incorporate the entire functional form of that hormone in our analyses. In addition, I compared various Phase I clinical trial dose-escalation methods (a "very small data" problem) by running intensive simulations (also in R) with <a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/iscr/faculty/profile.cfm?uniqname=tombraun">Prof. Tom Braun</a>.</p>

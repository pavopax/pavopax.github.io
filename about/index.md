    <h1>Current</h1>
    <p>
	Our newly-formed, small, entrepreneurial team at Genentech (San
	Francisco) uses machine learning and visualizations to help other teams
	gain new insights from their data.

<h1>Past Work</h1>
<p>
    In the past, I taught and developed machine learning course materials for
    an 8-week Data Science Fellowship and other educational programs at <a href="http://thedataincubator.com" target="_blank">the Data Incubator</a>.
</p>
<p>
   I also led a small team at <a href="http://methodofmoments.io" target="_blank">Method of Moments</a> which
   provided statistical analysis and consulting services to medical and other
   researchers in Longwood Medical Area, Boston, a top research hub.

<h1>Past Research</h1>

<p>
    I have a background in applied statistics, specifically in the field of
    public health. Until March 2015, I applied statistical methods to the
    design and analysis of clinical trials at <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/cbar" target="_blank">Harvard School of Public Health</a>.
</p>
<p>
    There, I worked with Dr. Heather Ribaudo, Director of Biostatistics and
    Programming, on the design of <a href="http://reprievetrial.org" target="_blank">REPRIEVE, the largest study ever in our network</a>,
    which included simulated power analysis (in SAS) of Cox survival models in
    the presence of "competing risks." Currently, we are developing statistical
    and data monitoring plans with our collaborators at Massachusetts General
    Hospital and elsewhere.  At the same time, I am involved in three other
    longitudinal studies; I combine and analyze datasets to produce graphical
    summaries and reports for our investigators and the public at large.
</p>

<p>
    While doing my Masters at the University of Michigan, I modeled the
    hormonal response of Cortisol using functional GLM (in R) with <a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/iscr/faculty/profile.cfm?uniqname=brisa">Prof. Brisa Sánchez</a>,
    where instead of using a summary statistic such as slope of response, or
    area under the curve, we wanted to incorporate the entire functional form
    of that hormone in our analyses. In addition, I compared various Phase I
    clinical trial dose-escalation methods (a "very small data" problem) by
    running intensive simulations (also in R) with <a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/iscr/faculty/profile.cfm?uniqname=tombraun">Prof. Tom Braun</a>.

<h1>Teaching Experience</h1>
<p>
    At The Data Incubator, I developed machine learning course materials for
    our fellowship (PhDs) and corporate programs. Two highlights:
</p>
<li>I wrote a teaching module on anomaly detection using Isolation Forests and One-class SVMs [Python]</li>
<li>I taught 3-day machine learning classes to two Fortune 100 analytics teams [R, Python]</li>

<p>
    In graduate school (University of Michigan), for the following courses, I
    taught section (lab), held office hours, graded papers, and directed review
    sessions, and sometimes developed course materials and taught lecture.
